 Building my own blog has always be on the top of my list. However, it is so easy to get distrated by other stuff while lots are going on.
 Now it is the time to pick it up! I will maintain this site for mainly three subjects below.


### Self reflection
Yes! Reflection! 

On my life, on books, on news, and more...

Since a dramatic beginning of 2020, I have been staying in Singapore for over a year. 
Thus it has been my first time to celebrate both Christmas and New Year here in a summer time.
2020 could definitely be one of the milestones of my life, like graduating virtually and starting the first full-time job.

To be fair, it was a pretty stressed period during the first half 2020 because of the bachelor thesis. 
But, fortunately, all endless pressures turn out to be endless happiness after the final presentation.
One more bonus is that I have quit the social media to focus on the real life (well, I am still on Linkedin :), which definitely saved me plenty of hours.

I do find reflection time to time very useful to think deeply and critically. What's more, it helps strengthen my understanding and stay longer in my mind as well.

### Documentation of learning journey
Yes! Documentation!

Software Engineer's favorite. Clear and neat documentaions could save engineer from lost in codes. 
I would like to document my study materials, for the purpose to:
* Develop good manners on writing clear documentation
* For my own reference
* If you happen to learn the same stuff :)

### Meet like-minded people 
Yes! Friends & Network! 

Since working from home, I do find myself having less opportunities to meet new people. I would like to 
take this blog as a place to meet some like-minded friends to maintain meaningful converstations on books, what's going on in the industry, sharing good learning materials/courses, etc.

## Keep going and always learning!

Well, I will end my first article with my favorite quote from my favorite book here, which pretty much represents my main personal core value as well.
